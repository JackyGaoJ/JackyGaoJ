## introduction
  My name is Jian Gao, a Master of Science in Computer Science student in Columbia University, also a previous alumni of The Ohio State University. I got my Bachelor of Science degree from The Ohio State University in May 2020 as a Summa Cum Lauda student with a GPA 3.92. During my time in OSU, my major was Computer Information Science, and minor is Mathematics.
  
  I enjoy coding, and frequently use Python and Java. I look forward to becoming a Software Enginner in the future. You could check my Resume here: [Jian Gao's Resume](https://jackygaoj.github.io/Resume.pdf).
